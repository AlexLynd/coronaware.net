# CoronAware

## About
This repository contains front-end prototype code for [coronaware.net](http://www.coronaware.net), a website dedicated to tracking OC Corona Virus cases and breakouts.  My friend Robin and I created this website since the official OC Health website was poorly formatted and we wanted to add a mapping feature.  Their website has since been updated.
