# CoronAware

## About
This repository contains front-end prototype for [coronaware.net](http://coronaware.net), a website dedicated to tracking OC Corona Virus cases and breakouts.  My friend Robin and I created this website since the official OC Health website was poorly formatted, and since we wanted to add a mapping feature that would let us visualize outbreak areas.  Their website has since been updated, but we implemented an [AI that predicted case outbreaks](https://github.com/robingan7/coronaware.net)  before archiving the site.
